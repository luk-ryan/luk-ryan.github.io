        <p>
          I started learning piano when I was four, beginning with group lessons
          and then moving to one-on-one sessions as I followed the Royal
          Conservatory of Music (RCM) program. This curriculum goes from levels
          1-10, each with a practical exam to advance and theory exams required
          from level 8 onward. I worked through all 10 levels with my teacherâ€™s
          help, finishing up in my first year of university. Now, I keep
          exploring new pieces and play for fun in my free time.
