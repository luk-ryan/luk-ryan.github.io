        <p>
          Tricking is a mix of martial arts, gymnastics, kicks, and flips, all
          in one sport. I discovered it a couple of years ago at a parkour gym
          called The Monkey Vault. Initially, I wanted to train for stunts—I’ve
          always admired my cousin, who works as a stunt double, and thought it
          could be a unique career path. But after watching trickers pull off
          impressive combos, I decided to focus on tricking instead. I also had
          the idea of teaching it as a new martial arts style at the dojo where
          I currently instruct.

          When I first started tricking, I picked up the basics quickly—even the
          beginner tricks are challenging! Unfortunately, about a year in, I
          fractured my big toe, which meant taking a three-month break from
          training. The injury slowed my progress, affecting not only my
          physical recovery but also my confidence in tricks that involve going
          upside down. Since getting back, I've been working hard to overcome
          this mental block and continue progressing with more advanced moves.
          My goal is to keep pushing forward and eventually bring tricking into
          the dojo where I teach.
